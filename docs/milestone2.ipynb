    "# Introduction to our BAD (Basic Auto Differentiator) Package\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "<!-- the problem the software solves -->\n",
    "This library solves the computational technique of automatic differentiation: a process to compute derivatives numerically within accurate machine approximation. This task is also called algorithmic differentiation, computational differentiation, auto-differentiation, or the acronym *AD*. The heart of AD lies in breaking down compounded functions to their basic components: arithmetic operations and elementary functions. The derivatives for these elementary functions are well known. Finally, the chain rule is applied to these operations and derivatives of any order can be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If complexity is low, a human can compute a derivative in one step using some memorized and nuanced rules. Often what is produced is *symbolic*, which is then evaluated for a numerical output for a given input. Computer cannot handle symbolic forms in the same way. They must either be given the values to make a direct computation, or the values that allow it to perform minor computations with those values and aggregate them with elementary operations like multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction. These are then compounded to form the overall derivative. While the approach is more sequential, the process is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivations\n",
    "<!-- why it's important to solve that problem -->\n",
    "Many algorithms today are *optimizational*: aiming to solve a problem according to constraint(s) to the best of its ability. Optimization requires the use of such derivatives. When dealing with problems with more than one dimension, we must adapt the simple optimization problem into a multi-dimensional optimization problem. Minimizing the error of a function for *machine learning* frequently requires multi-dimensional optimization. Besides outperforming humans for complex functions, computers can also easily compute derivatives for 2-D `numpy` array inputs, outputting Jacobian matrices of results. Computationally intensive problems as listed below require derivatives within a larger pipeline, and must be self contained. AD is necessary for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generally used to model *1D flow* and *heat transfer* problems.\n",
    "- Generally used to optimize the *aerodynamic* properties of a body.\n",
    "- Problems in *physics* and *material science* requires the analysis of functions that rely on time, position, speed, and other problem-specific metrics.\n",
    "- *Adjoint Differentiation* in financial risk management is exactly this process.\n",
    "- Using *heuristic artificial intelligence methods* like *hill climbing* or *particle swarm* require the adjustment of -- for example purposes -- a ball dropped into a plane and moved in the direction that gets the ball to the target point the fastest. \n",
    "- Can solve *Ordinary Differential Equations* with a removable singularity.\n",
    "- *Neural networks* require the adjustment of a vector of weights per layer, therefore requiring us to optimize with respect to some standard (function).\n",
    "- NASA used AD for *computational fluid dynamics* with a larger goal of modeling flight and expected turbulence of a given space-craft design.\n",
    "- General Electric used AD to automate the study of *unexpected satellite motion* due to differences in Earth's gravitational flow.\n",
    "- Northwestern University published work on using AD as a framework to *reduce diffractions in microscopic imaging*."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- (Brief) give the essential ideas of mathematical ideas and concepts (e.g. the chain rule, the graph structure of calculations, elementary functions, etc) -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation computes the derivative of a function by solving it as a collection of the derivatives of its components. These individual components are elementary functions, connected by known, simple operators. The purpose behind this separation is that the individual functions can be easily solved using pre-established rules. The automatic differentiator can then solve any function made up of these components. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Elementary Functions\n",
    "Some examples of elementary functions include $e^x$, $\\log(x)$, $\\sin(x)$, and $\\cos(x)$. Some examples of elementary arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Automated differentiation uses the chain rule to split the given function into these elementary operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derivatives\n",
    "A derivative describes the slope of a given function generally (produces another function denoted $f'$) or at a specific point by plugging in the value of interest into $f'$. In a general form, slopes tell us how much a response variable (usually $y$, which is often written as $f(x)$) changes when the input $x$ does. The best example of this concept is the equation of a line: $z = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope. In this case, $m$ is a number. When we look at more complicated functions, the slope is often left in its functional representation $f'$ and used by plugging in a point later for the slope at a specific point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slopes are the main component behind AD, since we are interested in how the given function behaves -- how our response variable changes -- as we \"look\" in isolated directions. If we have a function $f$ described by two variables $x, y$, we would want to compute two derivatives -- one *with respect* to $x$ while holding $y$ constant (think of it as just another number) and the other *with respect* to $y$ while holding $x$ constant. We can then answer the corresponding two questions of interest -- how much and in what way does the function $f$ change when $x$ does, and how much and in what way does the function $f$ change when $y$ does? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chain Rule\n",
    "The chain rule applies to any elementary functions with variable input, which occurs often. We will be applying the chain rule repeatedly to our elementary operators. The chain rule can be further explored here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a function $g(f(x))$. Then, the derivative of this function will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dg}{dx} = \\frac{dg}{df}\\frac{df}{dx}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when functions have multiple arguments, $h(f(x), g(x))$, the chain rule can be applied like so\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dh}{dx} = \\frac{dh}{df}\\frac{df}{dx} + \\frac{dh}{dg}\\frac{dg}{dx}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dual Numbers\n",
    "Another important component of automatic differentiation are dual numbers. Dual numbers have a real and dual component, expressed as $ z=a+b\\epsilon $. Here, $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the dual part. The $\\epsilon$ is a non-real number where $ \\epsilon^2=0 $ but $ \\epsilon \\neq 0 $. They are used to track the application of an elementary function on a normal scalar (the real part) and the derivative of that (the dual part) simultaneously for each step as part of our data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forward Mode\n",
    "In a general sense, forward mode is an iterative evaluation of the chain rule. The evaluation trace is the outline of this path, step by step. At each step, we record the elementary operation, the directional derivative, and the output when solving for some value. For complex functions, computer numerical storage is beneficial because this method requires tracking all of these operations. Forward mode is most efficient when a potential function has significantly more outputs than inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational Graph and Trace Example\n",
    "<img src=\"./forward-mode-graph.jpg\" alt=\"Rough sketch of computational graph and traces. We will update a computer-generated plot in future milestones.\" />\n",
    "Figure: Rough sketch of computational graph and traces for a basic sample function. We will update a computer-generated plot in future milestones. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "Note: We should add a computation graph and notes about forward mode (and reverse mode?).\n",
    "Note: We should make a table(?) of all the accepted functions and their derivatives/how they will be used? ($ a+b $, $ a-b $, $ ab $, $ \\frac{a}{b} $, $ a^{b} $, $ sin(a) $, $ cos(a) $, $ tan(a) $, $ ln(a) $)\n",
    "\n",
    "dkim: added brief notes about elementary functions, i think we should add a forward mode/reverse mode section as well as computational graphs for each\n",
