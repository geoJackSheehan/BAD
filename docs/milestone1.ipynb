    "### Problem Description\n",
    "<!-- the problem the software solves -->\n",
    "This library solves the computational technique of automatic differentiation (AD): a process to compute derivatives numerically within accurate machine approximation. This task is also called algorithmic differentiation, computational differentiation, or auto-differentiation. The heart of AD lies in breaking down functions by looking at a composition of elementary operations. The derivatives for these elementary derivatives are easily known. The AD algorithm breaks down functions by the elementary arithmetic operations and the elementary functions. Finally, the chain rule is applied to these operations and derivatives of any order can be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing derivatives can be an easy task for a human, simply apply a few rules here and there and some specific functional derivatives. If complexity is low, a human can compute a derivative in one step. A computer, however, runs computations one at a time (ignoring parallel computing), collecting the information about the small computations in memory. That is, calculations are made step by step, the result being applied to the subsequent computation needed in the grand scheme of computing the overall derivative. A computer must either be given the values to make a direct computation, or the values that allow it to perform minor computations with those values and aggregate them with elementary operations like multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many algorithms are *optimizational*, which requires the use of such derivatives. When dealing with problems with more than one dimension, we must adapt the simple optimization problem into a multi-dimensional optimization problem. Derivatives and algorithms that use them are utilities, primarily used for their contribution to a bigger project over intrinsic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivations\n",
    "<!-- why it's important to solve that problem -->\n",
    "Optimization is everywhere today, as it aims to solve a problem according to some constraint to the best of its ability. Minimizing the error of a function for *machine learning* frequently requires multi-dimensional optimization. There are a few more specific examples listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Neural Networks* require the adjustment of a vector of weights per layer, therefore requiring us to optimize with respect to some standard (function).\n",
    "- Using *hueristic artificial intelligence methods* like *hill climbing* or *partical swarm* require the adjustment of -- for example purposes -- a ball dropped into a plane and moved in the direction (x, y) that gets the ball to the target point the fastest. \n",
    "- Problems in *physics* and *material science* requires the analysis of functions that rely on time, position, speed, and other problem-specific metrics."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- (Brief) give the essential ideas of mathematical ideas and concepts (e.g. the chain rule, the graph structure of calculations, elementary functions, etc) -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation computes the derivative of a function by solving it as a collection of the derivatives of its components. These individual components are elementary functions, connected by known, simple operators. The purpose behind this separation is that the individual functions can be easily solved using pre-established rules. The automatic differentiator can then solve any function made up of these components. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Elementary Functions\n",
    "Some examples of elementary functions include $e^x$, $\\log(x)$, $\\sin(x)$, and $\\cos(x)$. Some examples of elementary arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Automated differentiation uses the chain rule to split the given function into these elementary operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chain Rule\n",
    "We will be applying the chain rule repeatedly to our elementary operators. The chain rule can be further explored here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a function $g(f(x))$. Then, the derivative of this function will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dg}{dx} = \\frac{dg}{df}\\frac{df}{dx}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when functions have multiple arguments, $h(f(x), g(x))$, the chain rule can be applied like so\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dh}{dx} = \\frac{dh}{df}\\frac{df}{dx} + \\frac{dh}{dg}\\frac{dg}{dx}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Mode\n",
    "In a general sense, forward mode is an iterative evaluation of the chain rule. Since computers require numerical storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computational Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'forward-mode-graph.jpg`/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reverse Mode\n",
    "In reverse automatic differentiation, we still separate the complex input function into the simpler, elementary functions. However, the chain rule pass begins at the end of the evaluation trace, and moves backwards through the steps of the function. Therefore, reverse mode contains two passes. First, a forward pass to calculate the primal trace. Second, a reverse pass to propagate backwards to the derivatives. When choosing between reverse and forward mode, it is important to keep in mind that if there are significantly more inputs than outputs, then reverse mode is more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "Note: We should add a computation graph and notes about forward mode (and reverse mode?).\n",
    "Note: We should make a table(?) of all the accepted functions and their derivatives/how they will be used? ($ a+b $, $ a-b $, $ ab $, $ \\frac{a}{b} $, $ a^{b} $, $ sin(a) $, $ cos(a) $, $ tan(a) $, $ ln(a) $)\n",
    "\n",
    "dkim: added brief notes about elementary functions, i think we should add a forward mode/reverse mode section as well as computational graphs for each\n",
